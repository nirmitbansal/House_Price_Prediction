**Overview**

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow to predict house prices using historical data. It is designed as a beginner-friendly ML project, covering data loading, model training, evaluation, model persistence, and prediction on new inputs.
The project uses Linear Regression and the California Housing Dataset to build a regression model that predicts median house prices based on socioeconomic and geographic features.

**Project Objectives**

Understand the complete machine learning lifecycle
Train a regression model on real-world data
Evaluate model performance using RMSE
Save and reload trained models
Make predictions for unseen data
Structure an ML project professionally for GitHub
