**🏡 House Price Prediction**

Predicting house prices using structured data & supervised learning  
🎯 Built with a clean machine learning workflow for interview & portfolio showcase

**✨ Why This Project?**

🔹 Demonstrates the complete machine learning lifecycle  
🔹 Clean, readable, and interview-friendly structure  
🔹 Focuses on practical implementation, not just theory  
🔹 Easy to explain and justify during interviews  

**🔄 ML Workflow**

✅ Data Loading  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Data Preprocessing  
✅ Feature Selection  
✅ Model Training (Regression)  
✅ Model Evaluation  
✅ Price Prediction  

 **📊 Model Evaluation**

Model performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics:
  
  • 📉 Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
  • 📐 Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
  • 📈 R² Score  
  
These metrics help validate the model’s predictive accuracy.

**🎯 Key Learnings**

✔️ Hands-on regression modeling  
✔️ Real-world data preprocessing  
✔️ Understanding feature impact on predictions  
✔️ ML project structuring for GitHub  
✔️ Interview-ready explanation skills
